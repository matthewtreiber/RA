# OUTLINE
# create class

# create class attributes

# create class methods
    # init function

    # for each method/function created, make a function header

    # create methods/functions


# NOTES
# data types - what are you trying to hold and use?
    # ints, doubles
    # list, dict, tupples
# loops - apply something to
    # for each
    # for in range
    # while
    # do while
# methods/functions - think modularity, apply an action to many kinds
#                    something (like a list of classes)
    # what will you do with the class?
    # how do you want to manipulate the data in the class?
    # priorize important data
    # steps to accomplish a goal with the object
